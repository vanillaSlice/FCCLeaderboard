# FCC Leaderboard

A leaderboard built using React that displays [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days. A working version can be viewed [here](https://vanillaslice.github.io/FCCLeaderboard/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
